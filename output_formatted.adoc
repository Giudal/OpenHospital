=== Intro: How to start OH

Start OH from a programming software, like Eclipse - the software used in this description. As the application is being loaded, a splash menu with the OH logo is shown. Then the login window appears: It has a dropdown menu with the user list, a password field, plus the “Submit” and the “Cancel” buttons. The administrator (admin, default password “admin”) can add and remove users, manage their passwords and privileges.

Once the user is logged in, OH shows the main menu, with all options granted for that user.

Considering the full administrator menu in the description of the entire OH system, there are 11 main options, plus the “Close” button to exit OH. Click on the “X” on the title bar, to log out and close the application.

* File: it has two options: “exit”, to log out as seen above, and “users”, to manage all OH users. The amministratore can create groups of users benefitting of the same set of rights. Click on “users” button to open a new sub-level with the “users” option to edit a single users’s settings and the “groups” option to manage user groups.
* General Data: it manages all data used by the OH database.
* OPD (Out Patient Department): this section allows the user to record, search, update and edit the patient's visits.
* Pharmacy: OH’s pharmacy records all items used by the hospital. This menu has three sub-levels: the “Pharmaceuticals” option to manage the pharmacy database, the “Pharmaceutical Stock” option to record movements between pharmacy and suppliers and the “Pharmaceutical Stock Ward” option to record movements within the hospital and its wards.
* Laboratory: this section allows the user to record, search and update the patient’s exams.
* Accounting: OH’s cash register records the bills generated from medical items and patient exams.
* Admission/Patient: this section allows the user to manager the patient database.
* Patient Vaccines: similar to the “Laboratory” menu, it records the patient’s vaccinations.
* Statistics: it generates Excel reports about the hospital activity on a given period of time.
* Printing: it generates a document with either the exams list or the diseases list, sorted by type.
* Help: it opens a .PDF file with the user’s guide.

== 1. Login

When starting OH for the first time, once it is being loaded, the main menu is immediately shown, as login is disabled. Open the project in Eclipse, click on triangles near the project name, the sub-folder “rsc” (below), and the file “generalData.properties”, containing all system settings. Row 3 shows by default the string “SINGLEUSER=yes”. Replacing “yes” with “no” on this string, the login window (on the bottom on the page) is

image:extracted-media/media/image2.png[image,width=440,height=387]

enabled. The user chooses his/her name from the dropdown menu with the user list, then enters the corresponding password. If username and password don’t match, an error window opens, showing the “password incorrect: retry”, message. Click OK to close this window and enable the login window again. If the password is correct, the user enters the OH system. The main menu is shown, with all the options granted for the given user.

The admin menu (left) has all

image:extracted-media/media/image4.jpeg[image,width=206,height=332]

the options enabled, while a

image:extracted-media/media/image5.jpeg[image,width=194,height=440]

guest menu (i.e., “Eduardo” menu, see also chapter 2.1.2) has a limited set of options. The administrator can edit all user’s privileges.

Data:

* user.US_ID_A (username)
* user.US_PASSWD (password)

== 2. File menu

image:extracted-media/media/image6.jpeg[image,width=642,height=560]


The “File” menu contains two sub-menus: “exit”, to close OH, and “users”, where the administrator can manage user access to the system.

Focusing on “users” option and clicking on its button, the new window shows two options, “users” and “groups”. The former allows the administrator to manage a given user’s privileges, while the latter allows to create user groups.

=== 2.1 Users (editing a single user)

image:extracted-media/media/image7.jpeg[image,width=397,height=218]


The “Users browser” shows the full list of signed users. When OH is opened for the first name, the list comprises of two users: the administrator, only person of the eponymous group, and a guest from the “guest” group (see chapter 1).

The bottom part of the menu disposes of some buttons to manage the table.

Data:

* user.US_ID_A (primary key, username)
* usergroup.UG_ID_A (foreign key referencing the user group)
* user.US_DESC (user description)

same of chapter 2.1

==== 2.1.2 New User

image:extracted-media/media/image8.jpeg[image,width=232,height=240]


Adds a new OH user to the “user” database. Choose the user group from the dropdown menu, enter the username in the “Name” field, then type the password, retype it on the “Retype password” field, and add an optional description to help identify the user. Click “OK” to confirm, or “Cancel” to return to the users table. If “OK” was clicked and no password was inserted, an error window shows the “please insert a password” message. Click “OK” to return to “New User Record” window. If the two passwords don’t match, an error window shows the “password incorrect, please retype”. Click “OK” to return to “New User Record” and retype the passwords. If they match, the new user is added to the users table (top on next page).

image:extracted-media/media/image10.jpeg[image,width=292,height=200]


Updates the user description. Select a row from the “Users browser” and click “Edit”. An “Editing user record” window opens. The “Description” field is freely editable. Click “OK” to save changes, or “Cancel” to return to the users menu.

If a row is not selected before clicking “Edit”, a “please select a row” window opens. Click “OK” to close the window to return to the user menu. This message will appear on every OH table, for all editing and deleting options.

Data:

* user.US_ID_A (primary key, username)

image:extracted-media/media/image13.png[image,width=217,height=108]


If the passwords don’t match, an error message (left) is shown, else a confirmation window opens (right) and the new password is stored in the users DB (bottom window). Clicking “Cancel” anytime, the operation is aborted and there will be no changes to the users DB.

Data:

* user.US_ID_A (username)
* usergroup.UG_ID_A (password)

=== 2.2 Groups (editing user groups)

image:extracted-media/media/image15.jpeg[image,width=442,height=140]


The groups feature helps the administrator assign the same set of privileges to a multitude of users. A hospital likely has more than a single pharmacist, or surgeon, etc. , so it’s useful to aggregate users by their role in the hospital. The “Groups browser” window shows the name of the group, and a description. Default groups are “admin”, for the administrator(s), and “guest”, with read-only functions enabled. On the bottom side of the table, there are five buttons to manage the groups:

Data:

* usergroup.UG_ID_A (primary key, group name)
* usergroup.UG_DESC (group description)

==== 2.2.1 New Group

image:extracted-media/media/image16.png[image,width=353,height=196]


Creates a new user group. Click “New” on the “groups browser”. Add the name and an optional description in the new window, then click “OK” to confirm. If the name doesn’t exist in the “usergroup" database, the group will be added, else a “the group is already present” message appears. If no name is inserted, a “please insert a valid user group” message is shown.

image:extracted-media/media/image17.png[image,width=421,height=132]

Click “OK” after both unsuccessful cases to add a proper name. Once a valid name is entered, the new group is added to the “group browser” table (right).

Data:

both “usergroup” attributes

==== 2.2.2 Edit Group

Edits the group’s description. It’s similar to the “Edit User” option (2.1.3). Select a row, click “Edit” and type the (optional) description in the new window. Click “OK” to save changes, or “Cancel” to abort the operation.

Data:

both “usergroup” attributes

==== 2.2.3 Delete Group

Removes an existing group, except the “admin” and groups which have users assigned to.

Select a row from the “Group Browser” and click “Delete”. The confirmation window is shown: click “No” to abort the operation, or “Yes” to remove the group. If “admin” is selected, a “You can’t delete admin” message appears; if there are users belonging to the selected group, a “This group has users” window is shown. The “usergroup” database remains unchanged after both unsuccessful cases. For the latter case, first remove those users before deleting the group. Then create a new group (2.2.1) and add the users (2.1.2).

Data:

* usergroup.UG_ID_A (primary key, group name)
* user.US_UG_ID_A (foreign key referencing user group, to which the user belongs; if the selected group has users, it can’t be deleted)

==== 2.2.4 Group Menu

image:extracted-media/media/image18.png[image,width=447,height=307]


Allows the administrator, and all the users with this feature enabled, to manage privileges for every group in the “usergroup” database. Select a group from the “Group Browser” window and click “GroupMenu”. A new window “Menu Item Browser” (left), reproducing OH’s main menu, opens. Click on the triangles to expand the menu items. Enabled functions are shown in black, while disabled options are shown in light grey. Double click on a single option to activate/deactivate it. Click “Update” to save changes, or close the window to abort the operation.

As seen in chapter 1,

image:extracted-media/media/image19.png[image,width=451,height=348]

“Eduardo” can’t read the user menu (“HELP” option) by default. The administrator, or any user with permission to edit groups, selects the “guest” row, clicks “GroupMenu”, then double-clicks “HELP” on the “Menu Item

image:extracted-media/media/image20.png[image,width=178,height=306]

Browser” window (left) and clicks “Update”. Now Eduardo can access the user guide, as the menu pictured on the right shows the “HELP” button.

Data:

* groupmenu.GM_ID (primary key, option ID)
* groupmenu.GM_UG_ID_A (user)
* groupmenu.GM_MNI_ID_A (option name)
* groupmenu.GM_ACTIVE (Y if the option is enabled, else N)

==== 2.2.5 Close Groups Browser menu

Closes the “groups browser” window. Click “Close” to return to the main menu.

The bill can contain more than one item of the same type, just repeat the operations shown in this chapter. Pictured left is the “New patient bill” window after the five steps previously explained. The “TO PAY” row shows the total amount of the bill, while the “BALANCE” row shows the money the patient owes the hospital. No payments were recorded for now, so the balance equals the value of the receipt. Before saving the bill in the database, it’s possible to remove an element. Select it and click “X Remove Item”.

Data:

* billitems.BLI_ID (primary key, item ID)
* billitems.BLI_ID_BILL (foreign key referencing the “bills” database, bill ID)
